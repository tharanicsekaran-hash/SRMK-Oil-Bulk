# ✅ Products Now Grouped by Size Variants

## What Changed

### Before
- Each size shown as separate product card
- Example: 3 separate "Coconut Oil" cards (500ml, 1L, 2L)
- Cluttered product listing

### After
- Products grouped by name with size selector
- Example: 1 "Coconut Oil" card with size buttons (500ml, 1L, 2L)
- Cleaner, more professional UI

---

## How It Works

### Frontend Grouping
Products are **grouped by name (nameEn)** on the frontend:
```
Coconut Oil 500ml  ─┐
Coconut Oil 1L     ─┼─→ 1 Card: "Coconut Oil" [500ml] [1L] [2L]
Coconut Oil 2L     ─┘
```

### Size Variant Selector
- Click size button → Updates price and unit
- Selected size highlighted in orange
- Add to cart uses selected size and price

### Database Structure (Unchanged)
- Each size is still a **separate product** in database
- Easier for admin to manage stock/price per size
- Maintains all existing admin functionality

---

## Features

## Example

**Product Card Display:**
```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│   [Image]               │
│                         │
│ Coconut Oil             │
│ Fresh and tasty...      │
│                         │
│ Size:                   │
│ [500ml] [1L✓] [2L]     │ ← Size selector
│                         │
│ Quantity: [- 1 +]       │
│                         │
│ ₹420.00                 │ ← Updates based on size
│                         │
│ [Details] [Add to cart] │
└─────────────────────────┘
```

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
1. **`/app/products/page.tsx`**
   - Groups products by `nameEn`
   - Sorts variants by unit (500ml → 1L → 2L)
   - Passes array of variants to ProductCard

2. **`/components/ProductCard.tsx`**
   - Accepts `variants` array instead of single product
   - Shows size selector with all variants
   - Tracks active variant with state
   - Updates price/unit when size changes

### Sorting Logic
Variants sorted in logical order:
- 500ml → First
- 1L → Second
- 2L → Third

✅ **Admin panel** - No changes needed
✅ **Product CRUD** - Works exactly the same
✅ **API endpoints** - No modifications
✅ **Cart functionality** - Works as expected
✅ **Search & filters** - Still functional

---

## Result
