# ✅ Products Integration Complete

## What Was Fixed

### Problem
- Customer products page showed 4 hardcoded products
- Admin panel only had 1 product in database
- **They were not connected** - changes in admin didn't reflect on customer page

### Solution
All **11 products** (4 product types with different sizes) are now imported into the database and fully integrated!
