### Middleware Protection
```typescript
// /admin/dashboard/* - Protected
- Requires authentication
- Validates ADMIN or DELIVERY role
- Auto-redirects based on role
```

### API Route Authorization
All admin APIs verify:
1. User is authenticated (NextAuth session)
2. User has appropriate role (ADMIN or DELIVERY)
3. Delivery users can only access their own data
